/**
 * <p>Copied from Spring framework to keep Java 1.3 compatibility.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>Handy class for wrapping checked Exceptions with a root cause.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>This time-honored technique is no longer necessary in Java 1.4, which
 * finally provides built-in support for exception nesting. Thus exceptions in
 * applications written to use Java 1.4 need not extend this class. To ease
 * migration, this class mirrors Java 1.4's nested exceptions as closely as possible.
 * <p/>
 * <p>Abstract to force the programmer to extend the class. <code>getMessage</code>
 * will include nested exception information; <code>printStackTrace</code> etc will
 * delegate to the wrapped exception, if any.
 * <p/>
 * <p>The similarity between this class and the NestedRuntimeException class is
 * unavoidable, as Java forces these two classes to have different superclasses
 * (ah, the inflexibility of concrete inheritance!).
 * <p/>
 * <p>As discussed in
 * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764543857/">Expert One-On-One J2EE Design and
 * Development</a>, runtime exceptions are often a better alternative to checked exceptions.
 * However, all exceptions should preserve their stack trace, if caused by a
 * lower-level exception.
